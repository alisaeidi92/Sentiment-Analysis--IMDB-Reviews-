    "We can see that the logistic regression with Gensim did not performed very good. Maybe some attributes could be tuned or other machine learning models like Naive Bayes or SVM could be used to improve it. But the neural network model performed better than other vectorizers and models about 87%. I tried other neural networks too but the best performance so far was 87%. Based on my experience from the last two models with Tfidf and CountVectorizer I only trained my model for 5 epochs to prevent overfitting and it seems that the model isnt overfitting by looking at the val_loss.\n",

    "As a conclusion, Neural network performed better than the machine learning classifiers except for CountVectorizer. Among the three vectorizers, Gensim performed the best with 87% and CountVectorizer had the poorest performance about 81%."
